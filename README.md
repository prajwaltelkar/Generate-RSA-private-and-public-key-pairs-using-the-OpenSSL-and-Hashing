# Generate-RSA-private-and-public-key-pairs-using-the-OpenSSL-and-Hashing
This is the repository created to show encryption,decryption,hashing methods in networking security.<br>
In this we use OpenSSL tool to show encryption and decryption of the file and also we shall work on hashing with SHA and md5.<br>

### OpenSSL
OpenSSL is a commercial-grade utility toolkit for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. It’s also a general-purpose cryptography library. OpenSSL is licensed under an Apache-style license, which means that you’re free to get it and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes (subject to some simple license conditions).
